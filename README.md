Machine Learning Model 

Research Question:

Is it viable to accurately predict whether a champion is suited to play in a TopLane/Jungle role in
the current game meta based on specific champion performance statistics, and if so, which
features are most indicative of this role?



The dataset is composed of match data from “League of Legends”, LoL, an online, team-based,
multiplayer game from Riot Games. LoL can be played casually or competitively with a
skill-based matchmaking dependent on player ranks beginning from “Iron” to “Challenger“, with
Challenger's consisting of approximately the top 0.017% of players. At the end of a match each
player is provided with individual performance data reflecting various aspects of the match.
However if the challenger underperformed in a game, the data from that could be misinterpreted.
Further exasperating this is the random empty cells throughout the datasets. This data was
gathered from Challenger players during January 2022, the data only includes one randomly
selected unique player from each match reviewed. The data was gathered from three different
servers, correlating to a specific region; Europe, Korea and North America.
